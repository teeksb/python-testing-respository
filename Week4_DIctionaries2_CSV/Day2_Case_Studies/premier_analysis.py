# Premier League Gameweek Analysis

# You're a Data Analyst at a sports analytics company (like Opta Sports, Sofascore)
# Your job is to analyze match statistics to provide insights for punters, team managers,
# sports journalists, and fantasy football players.
# You're required to analyze goal-scoring patterns from the latest gameweek.

# Sport analytics companies use exact techniques to power platforms like FPL, betting odds, tactical analysis, etc.

# The Problem
# We have goal data from 10 PL matches in a game week, and are required to:
# 1. Retrieve and display how many goals each team scored
# 2. Find the highest scoring teams and matches
# 3. Calculate goal statistics (average goals per match, most prolific teams)
# 4. Identify teams in good form vs struggling teams
