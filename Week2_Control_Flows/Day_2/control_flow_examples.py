# Golden Rule
# 1. Use if to decide
# 2. Use while to repeat until
# 3. Use for to iterate over


# One sentence summmary.
# if decides, while repeats, for iterates.

# Start
#   ├─ Do I need a decision only once?
#   │      └─ YES → if
#   │
#   └─ Do I need repetition?
#          │
#          ├─ Am I iterating over items or a known count?
#          │      └─ YES → for
#          │
#          └─ Do I repeat until a condition changes?
#                 └─ YES → while
