## **EXERCISE 1: Superstore Sales Analysis System**

### **Scenario**

You're a junior data analyst at a retail company. The sales team has provided you with a CSV file containing transaction records for the past year. Your manager needs insights to make strategic decisions about inventory, regional focus, and product mix.

### **Dataset Description**

You'll work with `superstore_sales.csv` for this exercise.

---

### **Your Tasks**

#### **Part 1: Data Loading and Exploration**

**Requirements:**

1. Create a function `load_sales_data(filename)` that:
   - Reads the CSV file using csv.DictReader
   - Converts numeric fields (Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit) to appropriate types
   - Returns a list of dictionaries
   - Includes error handling for file not found

2. Create a function `explore_data(sales_data)` that displays:
   - Total number of orders
   - Date range (earliest and latest order)
   - List of unique regions
   - List of unique categories
   - Number of unique products

**Expected Output:**

```txt
DATASET EXPLORATION
===================
Total Orders: 1,247
Date Range: 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31
Regions: West, East, South, Central
Categories: Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies
Unique Products: 342
```

---

#### **Part 2: Sales Performance Analysis**

**Requirements:**

1. Create `calculate_revenue_metrics(sales_data)` that returns a dictionary with:
   - Total revenue
   - Total profit
   - Total quantity sold
   - Average order value
   - Overall profit margin (profit/revenue * 100)

2. Create `analyze_by_region(sales_data)` that returns a dictionary where:
   - Keys are region names
   - Values are dictionaries with: total_sales, total_profit, order_count, avg_order_value

3. Create `analyze_by_category(sales_data)` that returns similar structure for categories

**Expected Output:**

```txt
REVENUE METRICS
===============
Total Revenue: $2,456,789.50
Total Profit: $345,678.90
Units Sold: 12,450
Average Order: $1,969.15
Profit Margin: 14.07%

REGIONAL PERFORMANCE
====================
West:    $856,234.00 | Profit: $120,456.00 | Orders: 425 | Avg: $2,014.67
East:    $723,456.00 | Profit: $95,234.00  | Orders: 389 | Avg: $1,859.78
